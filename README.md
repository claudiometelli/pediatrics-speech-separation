# pediatrics-speech-separation

### A speech separator used for pediatrics purposes

## Release 0.1

In this release the separator is working correctly but there more work to do.
The separation doesn't work appropriately with some patients audio,
so I need ti analyze them analyze them and apply some mathematic rules to work properly.

In this release there are also two instruments to be used, in `utils/executable`,
one is for splitting audios and one is to show spectrograms and time series.
